## Description

A general description of the field site is available [here](../).

These data are a concatenation of two datasets collected at different times. The first was collected in 2004 by Pascal Pasturel during an MSc by Research at Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, UK. These data are originally described in Pasturel (2004). The second half of the data were collected by Matthew Upson and Francois Clavagnier in 2011, and are described in Upson et al. (2013) and Upson (2014).

## Data descriptive

|Name|Units|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|year:| years | Year of data collection {2004, 2011}.|
|ID|| Code indentifying individual trees in the experiment closest to the soil carbon measurements. e.g.: 1CB4: Block one, Cropped treatment, Beaupre hybrid, tree 4. See Upson & Burgess (2013).|
|block|| Following the original experimental design, there are three replicate blocks (B1:B3).|
|ctrltmt|| This column describes whether the sample was taken from the silvoarable agroforestry experiment (tmt), or from surrounding arable controls (ctrl).|
|treat|| Cropping treatment. Either C for continuously cropped, or F for continously Fallow.|
|depth| cm | Depth from which the sample was taken in cm: {15, 45, 75, 105, 135}.|
|dist_m| m | Distance from sampled tree in metres {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.|
|length_cm_cm3| cm cm<sup>-3</sup> | Fine root length given in cm cm<sup>-3</sup> determined by the intersection described in Bohm (1979).
mass_mg_cm3| mc cm<sup>-3</sup>| Fine root length given in mg cm<sup>-3</sup>.|
