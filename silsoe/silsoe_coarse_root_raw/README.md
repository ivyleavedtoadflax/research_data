## Data descriptive

|Name|Units|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|tree|| The id of the tree next to which the root trench was dug. A tree id can identify any tree within the experiment: 1 (block one), C (cropped treatment), B (Beaupre hybrid), 4 (fourth tree).|
|year| year |Year of data collection {2011}.|
|block|| Following the original experimental design, there are three replicate blocks {B1, B2, B3}.|
|treatment|| Cropping treatment. Either C for continuously cropped, or F for continously Fallow.|
|dist_gp_m| m |Distance from sampled tree in metres. This is the same as column dist_m, but aggregated over each metre {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.|
|dist_m| m |Distance from sampled tree for each metre from the tree. I.e. for {dist_gp_m = 1, dist_m = 0.4}, this relates to samples taken at a distance of 1.4 m from the tree {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}.|
|size_mm| mm | Diameter size class of coarse roots in mm: {2-5, 5-10, 10-20, > 20}.|
|depth_m| m | Depth from which the sample was taken in m: {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}.|
|count|| Count of coarse roots >2mm diamter.|
