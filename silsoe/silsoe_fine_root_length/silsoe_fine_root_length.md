## Data descriptive

|Name|Units|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|year:| years | Year of data collection {2004, 2011}.|
|ID|| Code indentifying individual trees in the experiment closest to the soil carbon measurements. e.g.: 1CB4: Block one, Cropped treatment, Beaupre hybrid, tree 4. See Upson & Burgess (2013).|
|block|| Following the original experimental design, there are three replicate blocks (B1:B3).|
|ctrltmt|| This column describes whether the sample was taken from the silvoarable agroforestry experiment (tmt), or from surrounding arable controls (ctrl).|
|treat|| Cropping treatment. Either C for continuously cropped, or F for continously Fallow.|
|depth| cm | Depth from which the sample was taken in cm: {15, 45, 75, 105, 135}.|
|dist_m| m | Distance from sampled tree in metres {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.|
|length_cm_cm3| cm cm<sup>-3</sup> | Fine root length given in cm cm<sup>-3</sup> determined by the intersection described in Bohm (1979).
mass_mg_cm3| mc cm<sup>-3</sup>| Fine root length given in mg cm<sup>-3</sup>.|
