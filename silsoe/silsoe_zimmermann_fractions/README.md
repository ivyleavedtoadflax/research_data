## Description

A general description of the field site is available [here](../).

These data describe soil carbon fractions measured for a site in Bedfordshire, England in 2011, and are described in:
Upson & Burgess (2013) and Upson (2014).

Eighteen samples were taken from within samples taken for [soil organic carbon](../silsoe_soil_organic_carbon/). Fractionation was completed by Andy Gregory in the labs at Rothamsted Research under contract from Cranfield University using the Zimmermann (2007) method.

## Data descriptive

|Name|Units|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|sample|| Number of the original sample {1,2,3,...,18}.|
|block|| Following the original experimental design, there are three replicate blocks {1,2,3}.|
|ctrltmt|| This column describes whether the sample was taken from the silvoarable agroforestry experiment (tmt), or from surrounding arable controls (ctrl)|.
|distance| m | Distance of sample from sample tree. In the original experiment from which these samples were taken, several distances were sampled. For fractionation, a single distance was selected (2.5 m). Samples from the conventional arable control are allocated C.|
|depth| m | Depth from which the sample was taken.|
|OCC| % | Fraction of total recovered soil organic carbon. |
|fraction|| Zimmermann fraction: S+A, POM, s+c-rSOC, rSOC, DOC. See Zimmermann (2007).|
|mass| % | Proportion of total sample mass recovered.|
