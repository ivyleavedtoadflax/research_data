## Data descriptive

|Name|Units|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|sample|| Number of the original sample {1,2,3,...,18}.|
|block|| Following the original experimental design, there are three replicate blocks {1,2,3}.|
|ctrltmt|| This column describes whether the sample was taken from the silvoarable agroforestry experiment (tmt), or from surrounding arable controls (ctrl)|.
|distance| m | Distance of sample from sample tree. In the original experiment from which these samples were taken, several distances were sampled. For fractionation, a single distance was selected (2.5 m). Samples from the conventional arable control are allocated C.|
|depth| m | Depth from which the sample was taken.|
|OCC| % | Fraction of total recovered soil organic carbon. |
|fraction|| Zimmermann fraction: S+A, POM, s+c-rSOC, rSOC, DOC. See Zimmermann (2007).|
|mass| % | Proportion of total sample mass recovered.|
