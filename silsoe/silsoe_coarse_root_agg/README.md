## Data descriptive

|Name|Units|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|year:| years | Year of data collection {1996, 20014, 2011}.|
|block|| Following the original experimental design, there are three replicate blocks {B1, B2, B3}.|
|treat|| Cropping treatment. Either C for continuously cropped, or F for continously Fallow.|
|dist_m| m | Distance from sampled tree in metres. Finer scale measurements (over 0.2 m) were aggregated into distances of 1 m {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.|
|size_mm| mm | Diameter size class of coarse roots in mm: {2-5, 5-10, 10-20, > 20}.|
|depth_m| m |Depth from which the sample was taken in m: {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}.|
|count|| Count of coarse roots >2mm diamter.|
