## Description

A general description of the field site is available [here](../).

These data are a concatenation of three datasets collected at different times. The first was collected in 1996 by Julius Nkomaula during an MSc at the then Silsoe College, part of Cranfield University. These data are described in Nkomaula (1996) and Burgess et al. (1997).

The second dataset was collected by Pascal Pasturel in in 2004 during an MSc by Research at Cranfield University at Silsoe. These data are originally described in Pasturel (2004).

The final part of the data were collected by Matthew Upson and Francois Clavagnier in 2011, and are described in Upson & Burgess (2013) and Upson (2014).

Note that in 1996, sampling did not extend further than \num{4.8} m from the tree.

## Data descriptive

|Name|Units|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|year:| years | Year of data collection {1996, 2004, 2011}.|
|block|| Following the original experimental design, there are three replicate blocks {B1, B2, B3}.|
|treat|| Cropping treatment. Either C for continuously cropped, or F for continously Fallow.|
|dist_m| m | Distance from sampled tree in metres. Finer scale measurements (over 0.2 m) were aggregated into distances of 1 m {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.|
|size_mm| mm | Diameter size class of coarse roots in mm: {2-5, 5-10, 10-20, > 20}.|
|depth_m| m |Depth from which the sample was taken in m: {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}.|
|count|| Count of coarse roots >2mm diamter.|
