# General Description
This repository is home to data presented in the following PhD thesis, and the papers that arise from it:

Upson, M.A. (2014) The carbon storage benefits of agroforestry and farm woodlands. PhD Thesis. Cranfield University. Available at [http://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/9298](http://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/9298)

Files are arranged into directories of field site first, then measurement type. Each data file is presented with a description (as a .md file). Geopgraphical location of sampling points are provided in a number of formats (geoJSON, kml, .shp). The script for producing these plots is included as [geospatial.R](geospatial.R).

### File descriptions

|Filename|Author|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|clapham_psd.csv | Matthew Upson, Claire Smith | Particle Size Distribution | These data describe 72 measurements of particle size distribution (PSD) taken at locations at the Clapham Park field site, north of Bedford, UK. The full standard operating procedure for the laboratory procedures is included in the [thesis](http://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/9298) on p.301. The location of each sample is also given. In most cases, the values of interest are included in the columns SAND, SILT, and CLAY, but percentages of three different sand fractions are also given.|
|clapham_bd_data.csv| Matthew Upson | Soil bulk density | These data describe 1985 measurements of soil bulk density taken at Clapham Park during in 2013. Samples were taken using a slot auger and compared to measurements taken by the more usual core method. See [Upson (2013)](http://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/9298) p.91 for details.|
